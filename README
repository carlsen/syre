*** syre.html - a simple CSS3 animation test ***

Purpose: to test how some of the CSS level 3 properties behave in different
browsers and experiment with degradation in older browsers. Please note, that
this is not meant to be an exhaustive or even comprehensive test-suite. The
properties I am poking at are:

	animation
	@keyframes
	transform: translate rotate scale
	background (-image: gradient)
	opacity
	box-shadow
	text-shadow

TODO:

	* Font ?
	* box-reflect ?
	* Look at positioning and overall width/height/scale
	* Expand gradients
	* Rework degradation; IE6 should degrade to a grey page with a z-index hack
